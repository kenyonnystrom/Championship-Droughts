# Analyzing Championship Droughts
As a native of Minnesota born years after my home state last attained a championship in one of North America's "Big Four" men's professional sports leagues, I have always been interested in quantifying my...well, pain, and comparing it to that of other states and cities. With this in mind I have recently set out to do just that, aiming to illustrate championship droughts in unique ways and hopefully draw attention to a subject that only really gets press for franchises in huge markets.\
\
To attempt to apply the concept of a championship drought to a largely unified fanbase, I have created the concept of regional franchise hub cities. These hubs are represented by a single city to homogenize their definition and keep state affiliations ambiguous, which necessitates shifting certain franchises out of their native city. For example, the Memphis Grizzlies are associated in my data with Nashville, as Grizzlies fans in Memphis will tend to also be fans of the Nashville Predators and Tennessee Titans. However, there are some unique situations such as in Ohio, where Columbus-native fans of the Blue Jackets are not unified in supporting Cincinatti franchises against Cleveland or even Pittsburgh franchises, despite the proximity to the former city. Thus at the moment these hubs take my own discretion into account having done substantial investigation on the subject.\
\
The first graph I've produced attempts to quantify championship drought by "cumulative franchise years" since a franchise in the regional hub won a championship. In other words, all the years each franchise has played in its modern location since the hub earned a ring in any sport are tallied up and totalled together with those of all other franchises attached to the hub. The outcome can be seen below: \

The Minneapolis/St. Paul hub takes the crown with three of their four modern franchises having been around since the Twins won the World Series in 1991. Notably, Buffalo manages second place despite having only two franchises, highlighting the balance of total drought years against the number of teams that have failed to achieve the ultimate goal. One unique drawback of this formula is that it heavily weights the droughts of larger cities with more franchises, the clear example being New York where 9 teams have not managed a championship between them over the past 12 years. In some ways, though, this accounts for the sheer disappointment that comes with such a statistic. \
\
I hope to continue my efforts on this front, with the hope of putting together a compendium of championship drought measurements and writing some form of article presenting the findings.\

DISCLAIMER:  Before I am chastised for failing to take into account the Minnesota Lynx and their recent championship successes, I will point out the fact that despite our pride in this achievement, nobody else seems to care. Seriously, try bragging about a WNBA championship to the average American sports fan. A big part of fandom is flexing the success of your team against those of your friends and foes, and if they are not interested in the league your team plays in then it is difficult to get very far on this front. For the time being I have no choice but to ignore the women's game, despite the unfortunate nature of this fact.
